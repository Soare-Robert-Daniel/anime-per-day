# Animer Per Day

Very basic web page that shows the anime list grouped by day of the week and auto-sorted based on the current day.

#### Motivation

I wanted a simple list to know what anime I can watch today without to much bloated information like the ones you can find on the internet.

> ![NOTE]
> The anime list is subjectively selected by me, so it may not be the same as the one you are watching.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This fallow the standard Astro project structure. To change the anime data, you can edit the `src/data/anime-per-day.ts` file.


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
